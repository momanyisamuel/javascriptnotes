# Javascript history

Started as LiveScript, a language conceived by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 and later included in the 
Netscape 2.0 browser under the name of JavaScript.

# You can think of JavaScript as a term that encompasses the following three pieces:

## ECMAScript: 
The core language-variables, functions, loops, and so on. This part is independent of the browser and this language can be used in many other environments.
## Document Object Model (DOM): 
This provides ways to work with HTML and XML documents. Initially, JavaScript provided limited access to what's scriptable on the page, mainly forms, links, and images. Later, it was expanded to make all elements scriptable. This led to the creation of the DOM standard by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as a language-independent (no longer tied to JavaScript) way to manipulate structured documents.
## Browser Object Model (BOM): 
This is a set of objects related to the browser environment and was never part of any standard until HTML5 started standardizing some of the common objects that exist across browsers.

### Today, you can use JavaScript to do all of the following:

**Create rich and powerful web applications** (the kind of applications that run inside the web browser). Additions to HTML5, such as application cache, client-side storage, and databases, make browser programming more and more powerful for both online and offline applications. Powerful additions to Chrome WebKit also include support for service workers and browser push notifications.
**Write server-side code using Node.js**, as well as code that can run using Rhino (a JavaScript engine written in Java).
Make mobile applications; you can create apps for iPhone, Android, and other phones and tablets entirely in JavaScript using PhoneGap or Titanium. Additionally, apps for Firefox OS for mobile phones are entirely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. React Native from Facebook is an exciting new way to develop native iOS, Android, and Windows (experimental) applications using JavaScript.
**Create rich media applications**, such as Flash or Flex, using ActionScript, which is based on ECMAScript.
